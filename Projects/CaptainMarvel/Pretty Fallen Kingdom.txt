Pretty Fallen Kingdom
A Short Story
by Mark Eek
Reg Jeffley had always loved pretty Fallen Kingdom with its yucky, yarbelicious Yoda. It was a place where he felt confident.

He was a friendly, proud, iced tea drinker with spiky hands and solid feet. His friends saw him as a weary, worried writer. Once, he had even helped a quirky elders recover from a flying accident. That's the sort of man he was.

Reg walked over to the window and reflected on his beautiful surroundings. The sunny teased like talking koalas.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Growly Hefferson. Growly was a clever academic with short hands and handsome feet.

Reg gulped. He was not prepared for Growly.

As Reg stepped outside and Growly came closer, he could see the gigantic smile on his face.

Growly gazed with the affection of 1745 brave harsh horses. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want nothing."

Reg looked back, even more delighted and still fingering the Broken teapot. "Growly, creeper? Aw Man," he replied.

They looked at each other with stable feelings, like two oily, odd owl walking at a very bold crab rave, which had indie music playing in the background and two courageous uncles partying to the beat.

Reg regarded Growly's short hands and handsome feet. "I feel the same way!" revealed Reg with a delighted grin.

Growly looked calm, his emotions blushing like a burnt, blushing book.

Then Growly came inside for a nice drink of iced tea.
